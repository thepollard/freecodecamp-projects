      <p class="text">On the morning of August 11, 2025, a peculiar sight greeted park-goers at Central Park when a cartoonish duck, dubbed the "Funny Surprise Duck," appeared unexpectedly. This yellow, wide-eyed duck, clutching a hand grenade and submerged in a honey pot, brought laughter and confusion to the scene. Witnesses reported the duck waddling out of the bushes near the pond, its exaggerated expression and quirky accessories making it an instant hit among children and adults alike. Park officials were baffled by its sudden appearance, with no clear explanation of how this whimsical figure arrived.</p>
      <p class="text">The Funny Surprise Duck quickly became a local sensation, with visitors snapping photos and sharing the oddity on social media. Its honey pot, dripping with sticky gold and paired with a grenade, added a humorous twist that sparked playful speculation about its originsâ€”some jokingly suggested it escaped from a cartoon studio. Though officials are investigating, the duck has been left in place as a temporary attraction, delighting park visitors with its unexpected charm and adding a lighthearted mystery to the day.</p>
