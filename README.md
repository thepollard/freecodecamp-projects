# FreeCodeCamp Projects 🚀

This repository houses my hands-on projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), where I’m sharpening my front-end development skills one challenge at a time. Each folder includes code, notes, and a breakdown of the concepts I practiced.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/html-css` – Responsive layouts, accessibility practices, and modern styling techniques.
- `/js-algorithms` – Vanilla JavaScript problem-solving and DOM manipulation.
- `/certifications` – Projects aligned with FreeCodeCamp's certification paths.

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Fedora Linux environment

## 💡 Why This Repo?

I'm exploring developer roles that emphasize:
- ✅ Debugging and iterative improvement
- ✅ Building accessible and maintainable code
- ✅ Collaborative problem-solving

This repo serves as both a personal growth tracker and a resource for others learning these skills.

## 📌 Next Steps

I'll continue refining and expanding these projects, integrating:
- Automated testing with Jest or similar tools
- Deeper JS algorithm work (data structures and recursion)
- A portfolio site that stitches these together
